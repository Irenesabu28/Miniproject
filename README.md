# Electric Trip Detector

A smart, efficient Flutter application designed to monitor electric system statuses and alert users of trips. This app features a secure, mandatory authentication flow and a persistent profile management system.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Mandatory Authentication**: Secure sign-in and sign-up flow to ensure only authorized users access the system.
- **Smart Dashboard**: Real-time status monitoring (Normal/Trip) with notification toggles.
- **Persistent Profile**: Edit your personal information (Name, Email, Phone, Location) and have it saved locally using `shared_preferences`. Data persists even after logging out.
- **Optimized Performance**:
    - **Reusable Components**: Clean and efficient UI using custom widgets.
    - **State Management**: Uses `IndexedStack` to maintain tab states for instant switching.
    - **Efficient Storage**: Cached storage service for fast data access.
- **Privacy Focused**: No unnecessary hardware permissions (camera/mic) requested.
